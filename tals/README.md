Trust Anchor Locators
=====================

This directory contains the trust anchor locators (TALs) that are bundled
with Routinator. These are the TALs of the five Regional Internet Registries
(RIRs) as well as those for a number of test setups.

For more information, please refer to `src/tals.rs` which is the canonical
place to describe and categorize them.
