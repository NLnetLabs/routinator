# Configuration for Running Routinator as a System Service
# ========================================================
#
# This configuration assumes that the TALs are placed in
# /var/lib/routinator/tals and the repository cache is maintained in
# /var/lib/routinator/rpki-cache.
#
# It will start Routinator with an RTR server listening on port 3323 and
# an HTTP server listening on port 8323. Both are limited to localhost by
# default.
#
# You can use this configuration as
# /etc/routinator/routinator.conf and start Routinator with
# --config /etc/routinator/routinator.conf.
#
# This file contains only the relevant configuration options. For a complete
# example, see etc/routinator.conf.example in the source distribution or
# consult the manual page.
