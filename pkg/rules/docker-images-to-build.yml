# matrix field notes:
#   platform:    used by Docker to use the right architecture base image.
#                the set of supported values can be seen at:
#                  https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment
#                  from: https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#architectures-other-than-amd64
#                  from: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/
#                one must also take any "normalization" into account, e.g. arm64v8 -> arm64, see:
#                  https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/v1.4.3/platforms/database.go#L83

#   shortname:   used by us to tag the architecture specific "manifest" image.
#   crosstarget: (optional) used to download the correct cross-compiled binary that was produced earlier by the
#                'cross' job above.
#   mode:        (optional) set to 'copy' for cross-compiled targets.
#   cargo_args:  (optional) can be used when testing, e.g. set to '--no-default-features' to speed up the Krill
#                build.
