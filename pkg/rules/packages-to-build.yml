# matrix field notes:
#   platform:    used by Docker to use the right architecture base image.

#   shortname:   used by us to tag the architecture specific "manifest" image.
#   crosstarget: (optional) used to download the correct cross-compiled binary that was produced earlier by the
#                'cross' job above.
#   mode:        (optional) set to 'copy' for cross-compiled targets.
#   cargo_args:  (optional) can be used when testing, e.g. set to '--no-default-features' to speed up the Krill
#                build.

  # CentOS 8 became EOL and is in theory still usable as a build container as there is still a Docker image
  # available, and package installation can be done by switching the yum config in the container to use packages
  # from the CentOS 8 vault rather than the now offline actual CentOS 8 repository. However, due to experiencing
  # lots of timed out connections to the vault we will build the CentOS 8 compatible package in a Rocky Linux
  # container instead, as Rocky Linux is 100% compatible with CentOS 8. The server at packages.nlnetlabs.nl
  # however has a repo for CentOS 8, not Rocky Linux, and determines the repo to publish in based on the name of
  # the archive that we produce below which is in turn based by default on the container image used to build. We
  # therefore in this case need to specify that the O/S we are building for has a different name than the Docker
  # image we are building it in.
