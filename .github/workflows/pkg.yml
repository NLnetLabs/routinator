# GitHub Actions workflow for building and testing Routinator O/S packages.
# Uses GitHub Actions caching to avoid rebuilding Rust cargo-deb and
# Routinator dependencies on every run.
#
# Note: at the time of writing the GH cache contents expire after a
# week if not used so the next build may be much slower as it will
# have to re-download/build/install lots of Rust crates.
#
# Packages are built inside Docker containers as GH Runners have extra libraries
# and packages installed which can cause package building to succeed but package
# installation on a real target O/S to fail, due to being built against too
# recent version of a package such as libssl or glibc.
#
# Packages are tested inside LXC/LXD containers because Docker containers don't
# by default support init managers such as systemd but we want to test systemd
# service unit installation and activation.
