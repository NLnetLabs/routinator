# GitHub Actions workflow for building and testing Routinator O/S DEB and RPM
# packages. Uses GitHub Actions caching to avoid rebuilding Rust cargo-deb and
# Routinator dependencies on every run.
#
# Note: at the time of writing the GH cache contents expire after a week if not
# used so the next build may be much slower as it will have to re-download /
# build / install lots of Rust crates.
#
# Packages are built inside Docker containers as GH Runners have extra libraries
# and packages installed which can cause package building to succeed but package
# installation on a real target O/S to fail, due to being built against too
# recent version of a package such as libssl or glibc.
#
# Packages are tested inside LXC/LXD containers because Docker containers don't
# by default support init managers such as systemd but we want to test systemd
# service unit installation and activation.

  # Cross-compile packages in a separate job so that we can run it on the GitHub Actions runner host directly rather
  # than inside a Docker container (as is done by the `pkg` workflow). We do this because we use `cargo cross` to handle
  # the complexity of using the right compile-time tooling and dependencies for cross compilation to work, and 
  # `cargo cross` works by launching its own Docker container. Trying to launch a Docker container from within a Docker
  # container, the so-called Docker-in-Docker scenario, is more difficult for `cargo cross` to handle correctly and
  # didn't work when I tried it, even with `CROSS_DOCKER_IN_DOCKER=true` set in the environment, hence this approach.

        # O/S (e.g. Debian) when served from a single package repository MUST have
        # unique package_ver_architecture triples. Cargo deb can vary the name based
        # on the 'variant' config section in use, but doesn't do so according to
        # Debian policy (as it modifies the package name, not the package version).
        #   Format: package_ver_architecture
        #   Where ver has format: [epoch:]upstream_version[-debian_revision]
        #   And debian_version should be of the form: 1<xxx>
        #   Where it is common to set <xxx> to the O/S name.
        # See:
        #   - https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/190899
        #   - https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version
        # Therefore we generate the version ourselves.
        #
        # In addition, Semantic Versioning and Debian version policy cannot
        # express a pre-release label in the same way. For example 0.8.0-rc.1
        # is a valid Cargo.toml [package].version value but when used as a
        # Debian package version 0.8.0-rc.1 would be considered _NEWER_ than
        # the final 0.8.0 release. To express this in a Debian compatible way we
        # must replace the dash '-' with a tilda '~'.
        #
        # RPM
        # ==============================================================================================================
        # Handle the release candidate case where the version string needs to have
        # dash replaced by tilda. The cargo build command won't work if the version
        # key in Cargo.toml contains a tilda but we have to put the tilda there for
        # when we run cargo generate-rpm so that it uses it.
        # 
        # For background on RPM versioning see:
        #   https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Versioning/
        #
        # COMMON
        # ==============================================================================================================
        # Finally, sometimes we want a version to be NEWER than the latest
        # release but without having to decide what higher semver number to bump
        # to. In this case we do NOT want dash '-' to become '~' because `-`
        # is treated as higher and tilda is treated as lower.
