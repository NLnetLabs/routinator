Building From Source
====================

In addition to meeting the :ref:`system requirements <installation:System
Requirements>`, there are three things you need to build Routinator: rsync, a
C toolchain and Rust. You can run Routinator on any operating system and CPU
architecture where you can fulfil these requirements.

Dependencies
------------

To get started you need rsync because some RPKI repositories still use it as
its main means of distribution. Some of the cryptographic primitives used by
Routinator require a C toolchain. Lastly, you need Rust because that’s the
programming language that Routinator has been written in.

rsync
"""""

Currently, Routinator requires the :program:`rsync` executable to be in your
path. Due to the nature of rsync, it is unclear which particular version you
need at the very least, but whatever is being shipped with current Linux and
\*BSD distributions, as well as macOS should be fine. Alternatively, you can
download rsync from `the Samba website <https://rsync.samba.org/>`_.

On Windows, Routinator requires the rsync version that comes with
`Cygwin <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_ – make sure to select rsync during the
installation phase.

C Toolchain
"""""""""""

Some of the libraries Routinator depends on require a C toolchain to be
present. Your system probably has some easy way to install the minimum set of
packages to build from C sources. For example, this command will install
everything you need on Debian/Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: text

  apt install build-essential

If you are unsure, try to run :command:`cc` on a command line. If there is a
complaint about missing input files, you are probably good to go.

Rust
""""

The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of platforms,
though not all of them are equally supported. The official `Rust Platform
Support`_ page provides an overview of the various support levels.

While some system distributions include Rust as system packages, Routinator
relies on a relatively new version of Rust, currently 1.56 or newer. We
therefore suggest to use the canonical Rust installation via a tool called
:program:`rustup`.

Assuming you already have :program:`curl` installed, you can install
:program:`rustup` and Rust by simply entering:

.. code-block:: text

  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Alternatively, visit the `Rust website
<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`_ for other installation methods.

Building and Updating
---------------------

In Rust, a library or executable program such as Routinator is called a
*crate*. Crates are published on `crates.io
<https://crates.io/crates/routinator>`_, the Rust package registry. Cargo is
the Rust package manager. It is a tool that allows Rust packages to declare
their various dependencies and ensure that you’ll always get a repeatable
build. 

Cargo fetches and builds Routinator’s dependencies into an executable binary
for your platform. By default you install from crates.io, but you can for
example also install from a specific Git URL, as explained below.

Installing the latest Routinator release from crates.io is as simple as
running:

.. code-block:: text

  cargo install --locked routinator

The command will build Routinator and install it in the same directory that
Cargo itself lives in, likely ``$HOME/.cargo/bin``. This means Routinator
will be in your path, too.

.. Note:: Before you can use Routinator, you must first 
          :doc:`initialise<initialisation>` the application.

Updating
""""""""

If you want to update to the latest version of Routinator, it’s recommended
to update Rust itself as well, using:

.. code-block:: text

    rustup update

Use the ``--force`` option to overwrite an existing version with the latest
Routinator release:

.. code-block:: text

    cargo install --locked --force routinator

Installing Specific Versions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to install a specific version of
Routinator using Cargo, explicitly use the ``--version`` option. If needed,
use the ``--force`` option to overwrite an existing version:
        
.. code-block:: text

    cargo install --locked --force routinator --version 0.9.0-rc2

All new features of Routinator are built on a branch and merged via a `pull
request <https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pulls>`_, allowing you to
easily try them out using Cargo. If you want to try a specific branch from
the repository you can use the ``--git`` and ``--branch`` options:

.. code-block:: text

    cargo install --git https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator.git --branch main
    
.. Seealso:: For more installation options refer to the `Cargo book
             <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html#install-options>`_.

Enabling or Disabling Features
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When you build Routinator, `"features"
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html>`_ provide a
mechanism to express conditional compilation and optional dependencies. The
Routinator package defines a set of named features in the ``[features]``
table of `Cargo.toml
<https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/blob/main/Cargo.toml>`_. The table
also defines if a feature is enabled or disabled by default.

Routinator currently has the following features:

``socks`` —  *Enabled* by default
    Allow the configuration of a SOCKS proxy.
``ui``  —  *Enabled* by default
    Download and build the the `routinator-ui
    <https://crates.io/crates/routinator-ui>`_ crate to run the :doc:`user
    interface<user-interface>`.
``native-tls`` —  *Disabled* by default
    Use the native TLS implementation of your system instead of `rustls
    <https://github.com/rustls/rustls>`_.
``rta`` —  *Disabled* by default
    Let Routinator validate :ref:`advanced-features:Resource Tagged
    Attestations`.
    
To disable the features that are enabled by default, use the
``--no-default-features`` option. You can then choose which features you want
using the ``--features`` option, listing each feature separated by commas. 

For example, if you want to build Routinator without the user interface, make
sure SOCKS support is retained and use the native TLS implementation, enter
the following command:

.. code-block:: text

   cargo install --locked --no-default-features --features socks,native-tls routinator

Statically Linked Routinator
----------------------------

While Rust binaries are mostly statically linked, they depend on
:program:`libc` which, as least as :program:`glibc` that is standard on Linux
systems, is somewhat difficult to link statically. This is why Routinator
binaries are actually dynamically linked on :program:`glibc` systems and can
only be transferred between systems with the same :program:`glibc` versions.

However, Rust can build binaries based on the alternative implementation
named :program:`musl` that can easily be statically linked. Building such
binaries is easy with :program:`rustup`. You need to install :program:`musl`
and the correct :program:`musl` target such as ``x86_64-unknown-linux-musl``
for x86\_64 Linux systems. Then you can just build Routinator for that
target.

On a Debian (and presumably Ubuntu) system, enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install musl-tools
   rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
   cargo build --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release

Platform Specific Instructions
------------------------------

.. Tip:: GÉANT has created an
         `Ansible playbook <https://github.com/GEANT/rpki-validation-tools>`_
         defining a role to deploy Routinator on Ubuntu.

For some platforms, :program:`rustup` cannot provide binary releases to
install directly. The `Rust Platform Support`_ page lists
several platforms where official binary releases are not available, but Rust
is still guaranteed to build. For these platforms, automated tests are not
run so it’s not guaranteed to produce a working build, but they often work to
quite a good degree.

.. _Rust Platform Support:  https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html

OpenBSD
"""""""

On OpenBSD, `patches
<https://github.com/openbsd/ports/tree/master/lang/rust/patches>`_ are
required to get Rust running correctly, but these are well maintained and
offer the latest version of Rust quite quickly.

Rust can be installed on OpenBSD by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   pkg_add rust

CentOS 6
""""""""

The standard installation method does not work when using CentOS 6. Here, you
will end up with a long list of error messages about missing assembler
instructions. This is because the assembler shipped with CentOS 6 is too old.

You can get the necessary version by installing the `Developer Toolset 6
<https://www.softwarecollections.org/en/scls/rhscl/devtoolset-6/>`_ from the
`Software Collections
<https://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/SCL>`_ repository.
On a virgin system, you can install Rust using these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum install centos-release-scl
   sudo yum install devtoolset-6
   scl enable devtoolset-6 bash
   curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env

SELinux using CentOS 7
""""""""""""""""""""""

.. sectionauthor:: Rich Compton <Rich.Compton@charter.com>

This guide, contributed by `Rich Compton
<https://github.com/racompton/routinator_centos7_install>`_, describes how to
run Routinator on Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) using CentOS 7.

1. Start by setting the hostname:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo nmtui-hostname

2.	Set the interface and connect it:

.. Note:: Ensure that "Automatically connect" and "Available to all users"
          are checked.

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo nmtui-edit

3.	Install the required packages:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo yum check-update
  sudo yum upgrade -y
  sudo yum install -y epel-release
  sudo yum install -y vim wget curl net-tools lsof bash-completion yum-utils \
      htop nginx httpd-tools tcpdump rust cargo rsync policycoreutils-python

4.	Set the timezone to UTC:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC

5.	Remove :program:`postfix` as it is unneeded:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo systemctl stop postfix
  sudo systemctl disable postfix

6.	Create a self-signed certificate for NGINX:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo mkdir /etc/ssl/private
  sudo chmod 700 /etc/ssl/private
  sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
      -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
      -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
  # Populate the relevant information to generate a self signed certificate
  sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048

7.	Add in the :file:`ssl.conf` file to :file:`/etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl.conf`
  	and edit the :file:`ssl.conf` file to provide the IP of the host in the
  	``server_name`` field.

8.	Replace :file:`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` with the :file:`nginx.conf` file.

9.	Set the username and password for the web interface authentication:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd <username>

10.	Start :program:`Nginx` and set it up so it starts at boot:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl enable nginx


11.	Add the user *routinator*, create the :file:`/opt/routinator` directory
   	and assign it to the *routinator* user and group:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo useradd routinator
  sudo mkdir /opt/routinator
  sudo chown routinator:routinator /opt/routinator

12.	Sudo into the *routinator* user:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo su - routinator

13.	Install Routinator and add it to the ``$PATH`` for user *routinator*:

.. code-block:: bash

  cargo install --locked routinator
  vi /home/routinator/.bash_profile
  Edit the PATH line to include "/home/routinator/.cargo/bin"
  PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:/home/routinator/.cargo/bin

14.	Initialise Routinator, accept the ARIN TAL and exit back to the user with
   	:command:`sudo`:

.. code-block:: bash

  /home/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator -b /opt/routinator init -f --accept-arin-rpa
  exit

15.	Create a routinator systemd script using the template below:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/routinator.service
  [Unit]
  Description=Routinator RPKI Validator and RTR Server
  After=network.target
  [Service]
  Type=simple
  User=routinator
  Group=routinator
  Restart=on-failure
  RestartSec=90
  ExecStart=/home/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator -v -b /opt/routinator server \
      --http 127.0.0.1:8080 --rtr <IPv4 IP>:8323 --rtr [<IPv6 IP>]:8323
  TimeoutStartSec=0
  [Install]
  WantedBy=default.target

.. Note:: You must populate the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In addition, the IPv6
          address needs to have brackets '[ ]' around it. For example:

          .. code-block:: bash

            /home/routinator/.cargo/bin/routinator -v -b /opt/routinator server \
            --http 127.0.0.1:8080 --rtr 172.16.47.235:8323 --rtr [2001:db8::43]:8323

16.	Configure SELinux to allow connections to localhost and to allow
   	:program:`rsync` to write to the ``/opt/routinator`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
  sudo semanage permissive -a rsync_t

17.	Reload the systemd daemon and set the routinator service to start at
   	boot:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable routinator.service
  sudo systemctl start routinator.service

18.	Set up the firewall to permit :program:`ssh`, HTTPS and port 8323 for the
   	RTR protocol:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=ssh --zone=public
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" \
      source address="<IPv4 management subnet>" service name=ssh accept'
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv6" \
      source address="<IPv6 management subnet>" service name=ssh accept'
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" \
      source address="<IPv4 management subnet>" service name=https accept'
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv6" \
      source address="<IPv6 management subnet>" service name=https accept'
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" \
      source address="<peering router IPv4 loopback subnet>" port port=8323 protocol=tcp accept'
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv6" \
      source address="<peering router IPv6 loopback subnet>" port port=8323 protocol=tcp accept'
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload

19.	Navigate to :samp:`https://{<IP-address>}/metrics` to see if it's
   	working. You should authenticate with the username and password that you
   	provided in step 10 of setting up the RPKI Validation Server.
