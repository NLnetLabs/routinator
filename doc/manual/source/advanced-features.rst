Advanced Features
=================

Routinator offers several advanced features to let operators gain operational
experience with some of the ongoing work in the Internet Engineering Task
Force to improve and augment RPKI. 

.. note:: 

    The Hosted RPKI systems that the RIRs offer currently only support the
    creation of ROAs. To manage ASPA, BGPsec or other RPKI objects, you can
    run Delegated RPKI with `Krill <https://krill.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/>`_. 

ASPA
----

Autonomous System Provider Authorisation (ASPA), currently described in two
Internet drafts in the IETF, applies the concepts of authenticated origins we
know from ROAs to the propagation of routes. An ASPA is a digitally signed
object through which the holder of an Autonomous System (AS) can authorise
one or more other ASes as its upstream providers. When validated, an ASPA's
content can be used for detection and mitigation of route leaks.

You can let Routinator process ASPA objects and include them in the published
dataset, as well as the metrics, using the :option:`--enable-aspa` option
or by setting ``enable-aspa`` to True in the :doc:`configuration
file<configuration>`. ASPA information will be exposed via RTR, as well as
in the :term:`json` and :term:`jsonext` output formats, e.g.:

BGPsec
------

The goal of BGPsec, as described in :RFC:`8209`, is to provide full AS path
validation. For this operators will need to publish BGPsec router keys in the
RPKI. As there is currently very limited deployment, validating these objects
with Routinator is not enabled by default. 

You can let Routinator process router keys and include them in the published
dataset, as well as the metrics, using the :option:`--enable-bgpsec` option
or by setting ``enable-bgpsec`` to True in the :doc:`configuration
file<configuration>`. BGPsec information will be exposed via RTR, as well as
in the :term:`SLURM`, :term:`json` and :term:`jsonext` output formats, e.g.: 

.. code-block:: json

        "metadata": {

Resource Tagged Attestations
----------------------------

Resource Tagged Attestations (RTAs) allow any arbitrary file to be signed
‘with resources’ by one or more parties. The RTA object is a separate file
that cryptographically connects the document with a set of resources. The
receiver of the object can use Routinator to show these resources, and verify
that it was created by their rightful holder(s).

One practical example where RTA could be valuable is to authorise a Bring
Your Own IP (BYOIP) process, where you bring part or all of your publicly
routable IPv4 or IPv6 address range from your on-premises network to a cloud
provider. The document authorising BYOIP could be signed using RTA.

RTA objects can be generated using Krill, the RPKI Certificate Authority
software from NLnet Labs, and you can use the MyAPNIC hosted service. The
objects can be validated using Routinator if it is built with RTA support,
using the :ref:`features<building:enabling or disabling features>`
functionality provided by Cargo:

.. code-block:: text

   cargo install --locked --features rta routinator

You can now interactively validate an RTA signed object. If it is valid,
Routinator will report the resources used to sign the object:

.. code-block:: text

    routinator rta acme-corp-byoip.rta

    192.0.2.0/24
    203.0.113.0/24
    2001:db8::/48
