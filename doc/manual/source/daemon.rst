Running as a Daemon
===================

Routinator can run as a service that periodically fetches RPKI data, verifies
it and makes the resulting data set available through the built-in HTTP
server and via the RTR protocol. 

If you have installed Routinator through our software package repository, the
RTR and HTTP servers are only available on localhost for security reasons.
You will have to explicitly change this setting in the :doc:`configuration
file<configuration>` to make the services available to other machines.

When you have installed Routinator using Cargo, no servers are enbled by
default at all. You can start the Routinator service using the
:subcmd:`server` subcommand and specifying to start the HTTP server with the
:option:`--http` option and the RTR server with the :option:`--rtr` option.
You can of course also start both. HTTPS and RTR-over-TLS are supported
natively as well.

.. Note:: Routinator will not reread the trust anchor locators after it has
          started the service. Thus, if you add or change a TAL you must 
          restart Routinator or send it a 
          :ref:`SIGUSR1 <manual-page:signals>`.

If you're running Routinator on the IPv4 address 192.0.2.13 and you want to
start the HTTP server on port 8323 and the RTR server on port 3323, run:

.. code-block:: text

   routinator server --http 192.0.2.13:8323 --rtr 192.0.2.13:3323
   
Make sure IPv6 addresses are in square brackets, e.g.:

.. code-block:: text

   routinator server --rtr [2001:0DB8::13]:3323 --rtr 192.0.2.13:3323

Both servers will only start serving data once the first validation run has
completed. 

By default Routinator will stay attached to your terminal and log to standard
error. You can provide the :option:`--detach` option to run it in the
background instead, in which case logging information is written to syslog.
To learn more about what kind of information is returned and how to influence
what is logged and where, refer to the :doc:`logging` section.


.. Attention:: On Linux systems there is an overlap between IPv4 and IPv6. 
               You can’t bind to all interfaces on both address families,
               i.e. ``0.0.0.0`` and ``[::]``, as it will result in a 
               *‘address already in use’* error. Instead, to listen to both
               IPv4 and IPv6 you can simply enter:
                
               .. code-block:: text

                  routinator server --rtr [::]:3323
