API Endpoints
=============

The HTTP service supports GET requests on the following paths:

``/api/v1/status``
     Returns exhaustive information in JSON format on all trust anchors,
     repositories, RRDP and rsync connections, as well as RTR and HTTP
     sessions. This data set provides the source for the Routinator user
     interface.

``/api/v1/validity/as-number/prefix``
     Returns a JSON object describing whether the route announcement given by
     its origin AS Number and address prefix is RPKI valid, invalid, or not
     found. A complete list of VRPs that caused the result is included. For
     details about its contents see :doc:`validity checker<validity-checker>`.
     
``/validity?asn=as-number&prefix=prefix``
     Same as above but with a more form-friendly calling convention.
     
``/json-delta, /json-delta?session=session?serial=serial``
     Returns a JSON object with the changes since the dataset version
     identified by the *session* and *serial* query parameters. If a delta
     cannot be produced from that version, the full data set is returned and
     the member *reset* in the object will be set to *true*. In either case,
     the members *session* and *serial* identify the version of the data set
     returned and their values should be passed as the query parameters in a
     future request.

     The members *announced* and *withdrawn* contain arrays with route
     origins that have been announced and withdrawn, respectively, since the
     provided session and serial. If *reset* is *true*, the *withdrawn*
     member is not present.

In addition, the ``/log`` endpoint returns :doc:`logging<logging>`
information and the ``/metrics``, ``/status`` and
``/version`` endpoints provide :doc:`monitoring<monitoring>` data.
