.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Routinator collects and processes Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
data. It validates the Route Origin Attestations contained in the data and
makes them available to your BGP routing workflow.
.sp
It can run in one\-shot mode outputting a list of validated ROA payloads in
various formats, as a server for the RPKI\-to\-Router (RTR) protocol that many
routers implement to access the data, or via HTTP.
.sp
These modes and additional operations can be chosen via commands. For the
available commands, see \fI\%COMMANDS\fP below.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The available options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c path, \-\-config=path
Provides the path to a file containing basic configuration. If this
option is not given, Routinator will try to use
\fB$HOME/.routinator.conf\fP if that exists. If that doesn\(aqt exist,
either, default values for the options as described here are used.
.sp
See \fI\%CONFIGURATION FILE\fP below for more information on the format and
contents of the configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r dir, \-\-repository\-dir=dir
Specifies the directory to keep the local repository in. This is
the place where Routinator stores the RPKI data it has collected
and thus is a copy of all the data referenced via the trust
anchors.
.sp
If omitted, defaults to \fB$HOME/.rpki\-cache/repository\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-no\-rir\-tals
If present, Routinator will not use the bundled trust anchor locators
(TALs) of the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
.sp
Trust anchor locators are the starting points for collecting and
validating RPKI data. Each of the five RIRs provides a TAL that adds
resources from their area. For normal production installations, these
are the only TALs that should be used.
.sp
Using this option as well as the \fI\%\-\-tal\fP and
\fI\%\-\-extra\-tals\-dir\fP options you can change which TALs
Routinator should use.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tal=name
Use the bundled TAL with the given name in addition to any other TAL.
.sp
Each RIR TAL is available through this option as well as TALs for a
few select test environments. If you use this option with the name
\fIlist\fP, Routinator will print a list of all available bundled TALS and
exit.
.sp
The option can be given more than once.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-extra\-tals\-dir=dir
Specifies a directory containing additional trust anchor locators
(TALs) to use. Routinator will use all files in this directory with
an extension of \fI\&.tal\fP as TALs. These files need to be in the format
described by \fI\%RFC 8630\fP\&.
.sp
Note that Routinator will use all TALs provided. That means that if a
TAL in this directory is one of the bundled TALs, then these resources
will be validated twice.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-x file, \-\-exceptions=file
Provides the path to a local exceptions file. The option can be used
multiple times to specify more than one file to use. Each file is a
JSON file as described in \fI\%RFC 8416\fP\&. It lists both route origins that
should be filtered out of the output as well as origins that should be
added.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-strict
If this option is present, the repository will be validated in strict
mode following the requirements laid out by the standard documents very
closely. With the current RPKI repository, using this option will lead
to a rather large amount of invalid route origins and should therefore
not be used in practice.
.sp
See \fI\%RELAXED DECODING\fP below for more information.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-stale=policy
This option defines how deal with stale objects. In RPKI, manifests and
CRLs can be stale if the time given in their \fInext\-update\fP field is in
the past, indicating that an update to the object was scheduled but
didn\(aqt happen. This can be because of an operational issue at the
issuer or an attacker trying to replay old objects.
.sp
There are three possible policies that define how Routinator should
treat stale objects.
.sp
A policy of \fIreject\fP instructs Routinator to consider all stale objects
invalid. This will result in all material published by the CA issuing
this manifest and CRL to be invalid including all material of any child
CA.
.sp
The \fIwarn\fP policy will allow Routinator to consider any stale object to
be valid. It will, however, print a warning in the log allowing an
operator to follow up on the issue.
.sp
Finally, the \fIaccept\fP policy will cause Routinator to quietly accept
any stale object as valid.
.sp
In Routinator 0.8.0 and newer, \fIreject\fP is the default policy if the
option is not provided. In version 0.7.0 the default for this option
was \fIwarn\fP\&. In all previous versions \fIwarn\fP was hard\-wired.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-unsafe\-vrps=policy
This option defines how to deal with \(dqunsafe VRPs.\(dq If the address
prefix of a VRP overlaps with any resources assigned to a CA that has
been rejected because if failed to validate completely, the VRP is said
to be unsafe since using it may lead to legitimate routes being flagged
as RPKI invalid.
.sp
There are three options how to deal with unsafe VRPs:
.sp
A policy of \fIreject\fP will filter out these VRPs. Warnings will be
logged to indicate which VRPs have been filtered
.sp
The \fIwarn\fP policy will log warnings for unsafe VRPs but will add them
to the valid VRPs.
.sp
Finally, the \fIaccept\fP policy will quietly add unsafe VRPs to the valid
VRPs. This is the default policy.
.sp
For more information on the process of validation implemented in
Routinator, see the section \fI\%VALIDATION\fP below.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-unknown\-objects=policy
Defines how to deal with unknown types  of  RPKI  objects.  Currently,
only certificates (.cer), CRLs (.crl), manifests (.mft), ROAs (.roa),
and Ghostbuster Records (.gbr) are allowed to appear in the RPKI
repository.
.sp
There are, once more, three policies for dealing with an object of any
other type:
.sp
The \fIreject\fP policy will reject the object as well as the entire CA.
Consequently, an unknown object appearing in a CA will mark all other
objects issued by the CA as invalid as well.
.sp
The policy of \fIwarn\fP will log a warning, ignore the object, and accept
all known objects issued by the CA.
.sp
The similar policy of \fIaccept\fP will quietly ignore the object and
accept all known objects issued by the CA.
.sp
The default policy if the option is missing is \fIwarn\fP\&.
.sp
Note that even if unknown objects are accepted, they must appear in
the manifest and the hash over their content must match the one given
in the manifest. If the hash does not match, the CA and all its objects
are still rejected.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-limit\-v4\-len=length, \-\-limit\-v6\-len=length
If present, defines the maximum length of IPv4 prefixes or IPv6
prefixes, respectively, that will be included in the VRP data set. All
VRPs for prefixes with a longer prefix length will be ignored. Note that
only the prefix length itself, not the max length is considered.
.sp
If either option is missing, VRPs for all prefixes of that particular
address family are included.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-dubious\-hosts
As a precaution, Routinator will reject rsync and HTTPS URIs from RPKI
data with dubious host names. In particular, it will reject the name
\fIlocalhost\fP, host names that consist of IP addresses, and a host name
that contains an explicit port.
.sp
This option allows to disable this filtering.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-fresh
Delete and re\-initialize the local data storage before starting. This
option should be used when Routinator fails after reporting corrupt
data storage.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-rsync
If this option is present, rsync is disabled and only RRDP will be
used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rsync\-command=command
Provides the command to run for rsync. This is only the command itself.
If you need to provide options to rsync, use the \fBrsync\-args\fP
configuration file setting instead.
.sp
If this option is not given, Routinator will simply run rsync and hope
that it is in the path.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rsync\-timeout=seconds
Sets the number of seconds an rsync command is allowed to run before it
is terminated early. This protects against hanging rsync commands that
prevent Routinator from continuing. The default is 300 seconds which
should be long enough except for very slow networks. Set the option to
0 to disable the timeout.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-rrdp
If this option is present, RRDP is disabled and only rsync will be
used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-fallback=policy
Defines the circumstance when access via rsync should be tried for a
CA that announces it can be updated via RRDP. In general, access via
RRDP is less resource intensive and more secure than rsync and will
therefore be preferred. This option specifies what to do when access
to an RRDP repository fails.
.sp
The policy \fBnever\fP means that rsync is never tried for a CA that
announces RRDP.
.sp
The policy \fBstale\fP means that rsync is tried if an update via RRDP
fails and there is no current local copy of the RRDP repository. A
local copy is considered current if it was last updated within a
time span chosen on a per\-repository basis between the
\fI\%\-\-refresh\fP time and \fI\%\-\-rrdp\-fallback\-time\fP\&.
.sp
The policy \fBnew\fP means that rsync is tried if an update via RRDP
fails and there is no local copy of the RRDP repository at all. In
other words, an update via RRDP has never succeeded for the repository.
Choosing this policy allows a repository operator some leeway when
first enabling RRDP support.
.sp
The default policy if this option is not given is \fBstale\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-fallback\-time=seconds
Sets the maximum time in seconds since a last successful update of an
RRDP repository before Routinator falls back to using rsync. The
default is 3600 seconds. If the given value is smaller than twice the
refresh time, it is silently increased to that value.
.sp
The actual time is chosen at random between the refresh time and this
value in order to spread out load on the rsync server.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-max\-delta\-count=count
If the number of deltas necessary to update an RRDP repository is
larger than the value provided by this option, the snapshot is used
instead. If the option is missing, the default of 100 is used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-timeout=seconds
Sets the timeout in seconds for any RRDP\-related network operation,
i.e., connects, reads, and writes. If this option is omitted, the
default timeout of 300 seconds is used. Set the option to 0 to disable
the timeout.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-connect\-timeout=seconds
Sets the timeout in seconds for RRDP connect requests. If omitted, the
general timeout will be used.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-tcp\-keepalive=seconds
Sets the value of the TCP keepalive duration in seconds for RRDP
connections. The default if this option is omitted is 60 seconds. Set
the option to 0 to disable the use of TCP keepalives.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-local\-addr=addr
If present, sets the local address that the RRDP client should bind to
when doing outgoing requests.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-root\-cert=path
This option provides a path to a file that contains a certificate in
PEM encoding that should be used as a trusted certificate for HTTPS
server authentication. The option can be given more than once.
.sp
Providing this option does \fInot\fP disable the set of regular HTTPS
authentication trust certificates.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-proxy=uri
This option provides the URI of a proxy to use for all HTTP connections
made by the RRDP client. It can be either an HTTP or a SOCKS URI. The
option can be given multiple times in which case proxies are tried in
the given order.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rrdp\-keep\-responses=path
If this option is enabled, the bodies of all HTTPS responses received
from RRDP servers will be stored under \fIpath\fP\&. The sub\-path will be
constructed using the components of the requested URI. For the
responses to the notification files, the timestamp is appended to the
path to make it possible to distinguish the series of requests made
over time.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-object\-size=BYTES
Limits the size of individual objects received via either rsync or RRDP
to the given number of bytes. The default value if this option is not
present is 20,000,000 (i.e., 20 MBytes). Use a value of 0 to disable
the limit.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-ca\-depth=count
The maximum number of CAs a given CA may be away from a trust anchor
certificate before it is rejected. The default value is 32.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enable\-bgpsec
If this option is present, BGPsec router keys will be processed
during validation and included in the produced data set.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dirty
If this option is present, unused files and directories will not be
deleted from the repository directory after each validation run.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-validation\-threads=count
Sets the number of threads to distribute work to for validation. Note
that the current processing model validates trust anchors all in one
go, so you are likely to see less than that number of threads used
throughout the validation run.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Print more information. If given twice, even more information is
printed.
.sp
More specifically, a single \fI\%\-v\fP increases the log level from
the default of \fIwarn\fP to \fIinfo\fP, specifying it more than once increases
it to \fIdebug\fP\&.
.sp
See \fI\%LOGGING\fP below for more information on what information is logged
at the different levels.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Print less information. Given twice, print nothing at all.
.sp
A single \fI\%\-q\fP will drop the log level to \fIerror\fP\&. Repeating
\fI\%\-q\fP more than once turns logging off completely.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-syslog
Redirect logging output to syslog.
.sp
This option is implied if a command is used that causes Routinator to
run in daemon mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-syslog\-facility=facility
If logging to syslog is used, this option can be used to specify the
syslog facility to use. The default is \fIdaemon\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-logfile=path
Redirect logging output to the given file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print some help information.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information.
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
Routinator provides a number of operations around the local RPKI repository.
These can be requested by providing different commands on the command line.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B vrps
This command requests that Routinator update the local repository and
then validate the Route Origin Attestations in the repository and output
the valid route origins, which are also known as Validated ROA Payloads
or VRPs, as a list.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-o file, \-\-output=file
Specifies the output file to write the list to. If this option is
missing or file is \fB\-\fP the list is printed to standard output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-f format, \-\-format=format
The output format to use. Routinator currently supports the
following formats:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B csv
The list is formatted as lines of comma\-separated values of
the autonomous system number, the prefix in slash notation,
the maximum prefix length, and an abbreviation for the
trust anchor the entry is derived from. The latter is the
name of the TAL file without the extension \fI\&.tal\fP\&. This can
be overwritten with the \fItal\-labels\fP config file option.
.sp
This is the default format used if the \fI\%\-f\fP option
is missing.
.TP
.B csvcompat
The same as \fIcsv\fP except that all fields are embedded in
double quotes and the autonomous system number is given
without the prefix \fBAS\fP\&. This format is pretty much
identical to the CSV produced by the RIPE NCC Validator.
.TP
.B csvext
An extended version of csv each line contains these
comma\-separated values: the rsync URI of the ROA the line
is taken from (or \(dqN/A\(dq if it isn\(aqt from a ROA), the
autonomous system number, the prefix in slash notation, the
maximum prefix length, the not\-before date and not\-after
date of the validity of the ROA.
.sp
This format was used in the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator version
1. That version produces one file per trust anchor. This is
not currently supported by Routinator \-\- all entries will
be in one single output file.
.TP
.B json
The list is placed into a JSON object with up to four
members: \fIroas\fP contains the validated route origin
authorizations, \fIrouterKeys\fP contains the validated
BGPsec router keys, \fIaspas\fP contains the validated
ASPA payload, and \fImetadata\fP contains some information
about the validation run itself. Of the first three, only
those members are present that have not been disabled or
excluded.
.sp
The \fIroas\fP member contains an array of objects with four
elements each: The autonomous system number of the network
authorized to originate a prefix in \fIasn\fP, the prefix in
slash notation in \fIprefix\fP, the maximum prefix length of
the announced route in \fImaxLength\fP, and the trust anchor
from which the authorization was derived in \fIta\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIrouterKeys\fP member contains an array of objects with
four elements each: The autonomous system using the router
key is given in \fIasn\fP, the key identifier as a string of
hexadecimal digits in \fISKI\fP, the actual public key as a
Base 64 encoded string in \fIrouterPublicKey\fP, and the trust
anchor from which the authorization was derived in \fIta\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIaspa\fP member contains an array of objects with four
members each: The \fIcustomer\fP member contains the customer
ASN, \fIafi\fP the address family as either \(dqipv4\(dq or \(dqipv6\(dq,
\fIproviders\fP contains the provider ASN set as an array, and
the trust anchor from which the authorization was derived
in \fIta\fP\&.
.sp
The output object also includes a member named \fImetadata\fP
which provides additional information. Currently, this is a
member \fIgenerated\fP which provides the time the list was
generated as a Unix timestamp, and a member \fIgeneratedTime\fP
which provides the same time but in the standard ISO date
format.
.sp
If only route origins are included, this format is identical
to that produced by the RIPE NCC
RPKI Validator except for different naming of the trust
anchor.
Routinator uses the name of the TAL file without the
extension \fI\&.tal\fP whereas the RIPE NCC Validator has a
dedicated name for each.
.TP
.B jsonext
The list is placed into a JSON object with up to four
members: \fIroas\fP contains the validated route origin
authorizations, \fIrouterKeys\fP contains the validated
BGPsec router keys, \fIaspas\fP contains the validated
ASPA payload, and \fImetadata\fP contains some information
about the validation run itself. Of the first three, only
those members are present that have not been disabled or
excluded.
.sp
The \fIroas\fP member contains an array of objects with four
elements each: The autonomous system number of the network
authorized to originate a prefix in \fIasn\fP, the prefix in
slash notation in \fIprefix\fP, the maximum prefix length of
the announced route in \fImaxLength\fP, and extended
information about the source of the authorization in
\fIsource\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIrouterKeys\fP member contains an array of objects with
four elements each: The autonomous system using the router
key is given in \fIasn\fP, the key identifier as a string of
hexadecimal digits in \fISKI\fP, the actual public key as a
Base 64 encoded string in \fIrouterPublicKey\fP, and extended
information about the source of the key is contained in
\fIsource\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIaspa\fP member contains an array of objects with four
members each: The \fIcustomer\fP member contains the customer
ASN, \fIafi\fP the address family as either \(dqipv4\(dq or \(dqipv6\(dq,
\fIproviders\fP contains the provider ASN set as an array, and
information about the source of the data can be found in
\fIsource\fP\&.
.sp
This source information the same for route origins and
router keys. It consists of an array. Each item in that
array is an object providing details of a source.
The object will have a \fItype\fP of \fIroa\fP if it was derived
from a valid ROA object, \fIcer\fP if it was derived from
a published router certificate, or \fIexception\fP if it was an
assertion in a local exception file.
.sp
For RPKI objects, \fItal\fP provides the name of the trust
anchor locator the object was published under, \fIuri\fP
provides the rsync URI of the ROA or router certificate,
\fIvalidity\fP provides the validity of the ROA itself, and
\fIchainValidity\fP the validity considering the validity of
the certificates along the validation chain.
.sp
For  assertions from local exceptions, \fIpath\fP will provide
the path of the local exceptions file and, optionally,
\fIcomment\fP will provide the comment if given for the
assertion.
.sp
The output object also includes a member named \fImetadata\fP
which provides additional information. Currently, this is a
member \fIgenerated\fP which provides the time the list was
generated as a Unix timestamp, and a member \fIgeneratedTime\fP
which provides the same time but in the standard ISO date
format.
.sp
Please note that because of this additional information,
output in \fBjsonext\fP format will be quite large.
.TP
.B slurm
The list is formatted as locally added assertions of a
local exceptions file defined by RFC 8416 (also known as
SLURM). The produced file will have empty validation
output filters.
.TP
.B openbgpd
Choosing this format causes Routinator to produce a
\fIroa\-set\fP configuration item for the OpenBGPD
configuration.
.TP
.B bird1
Choosing this format causes Routinator to produce a \fIroa
table\fP configuration item for the BIRD1 configuration.
.TP
.B bird2
Choosing this format causes Routinator to produce a \fIroa
table\fP configuration item for the BIRD2 configuration.
.TP
.B rpsl
This format produces a list of RPSL objects with the
authorization in the fields \fIroute\fP, \fIorigin\fP, and
\fIsource\fP\&. In addition, the fields \fIdescr\fP, \fImnt\-by\fP,
\fIcreated\fP, and \fIlast\-modified\fP, are present with more or
less meaningful values.
.TP
.B summary
This format produces a summary of the content of the RPKI
repository. For each trust anchor, it will print the number
of verified ROAs and VRPs. Note that this format does not
take filters into account. It will always provide numbers
for the complete repository.
.TP
.B none
This format produces no output whatsoever.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-noupdate
The repository will not be updated before producing the list.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-\-complete
If any of the rsync commands needed to update the repository
failed, complete the operation but provide exit status 2. If this
option is not given, the operation will complete with exit status
0 in this case.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-a asn, \-\-select\-asn=asn
Only output VRPs for the given ASN. The option can be given
multiple times, in which case VRPs for all provided ASNs are
provided. ASNs can be given with or without the prefix \fIAS\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-p prefix, \-\-select\-prefix=prefix
Only output VRPs with an address prefix that covers the given
prefix, i.e., whose prefix is equal to or less specific than the
given prefix. This will include VRPs regardless of their ASN and
max length. In other words, the output will include all VRPs that
need to be considered when deciding whether an announcement for
the prefix is RPKI valid or invalid.
.sp
The option can be given multiple times, in which case VRPs for all
prefixes are provided. It can also be combined with one or more
ASN selections. Then all matching VRPs are included. That is,
selectors combine as \(dqor\(dq not \(dqand\(dq.

.B server
This command causes Routinator to act as a server for the
RPKI\-to\-Router (RTR) and HTTP protocols. In this mode, Routinator will
read all the Trust Anchor Locators and will stay attached to the
terminal unless the \fI\%\-d\fP option is given.
.sp
The server will periodically update the local repository, every ten
minutes by default, notify any clients of changes, and let them fetch
validated data. It will not, however, reread the trust anchor
locators. Thus, if you update them, you will have to restart
Routinator.
.sp
You can provide a number of addresses and ports to listen on for RTR
and HTTP through command line options or their configuration file
equivalent. Currently, Routinator will only start listening on these
ports after an initial validation run has finished.
.sp
It will not listen on any sockets unless explicitly specified. It will
still run and periodically update the repository. This might be useful
for use with \fI\%vrps\fP mode with the \fI\%\-n\fP option.

enabled on all RTR connections with an idle time of 60 seconds.
Set this option to 0 to disable keepalives.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \-\-expire=seconds
The amount of seconds to an RTR client can keep using data if
it cannot refresh it. After that time, the client should
discard the data. Note that this value was introduced in
version 1 of the RTR protocol and is thus not relevant for
clients that only implement version 0. The default value, as
recommended in \fI\%RFC 8210\fP, is 7200 seconds.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-history=count
In RTR, a client can request to only receive the changes that
happened since the last version of the data it had seen. This
option sets how many change sets the server will at most keep.
If a client requests changes from an older version, it will get
the current full set.
.sp
Note that routers typically stay connected with their RTR
server and therefore really only ever need one single change
set. Additionally, if RTR server or router are restarted, they
will have a new session with new change sets and need to
exchange a full data set, too. Thus, increasing the value
probably only ever increases memory consumption.

.B /api/v1/validity/as\-number/prefix
Returns a JSON object describing whether the route announcement given
by its origin AS Number and address prefix is RPKI valid, invalid, or
not found.  The returned object is compatible with that provided by the
RIPE NCC RPKI Validator. For more information, see
\fI\%https://ripe.net/support/documentation/developer\-documentation/rpki\-validator\-api\fP
.TP
.B /validity?asn=as\-number&prefix=prefix
Same as above but with a more form\-friendly calling convention.
.TP
.B /json\-delta, /json\-delta?session=session&serial=serial
Returns a JSON object with the changes since the dataset version
identified by the \fIsession\fP and \fIserial\fP query parameters. If a delta
cannot be produced from that version, the full data set is returned and
the member \fIreset\fP in the object will be set to \fItrue\fP\&. In either case,
the members \fIsession\fP and \fIserial\fP identify the version of the data set
returned and their values should be passed as the query parameters in a
future request.
.sp
The members \fIannounced\fP and \fIwithdrawn\fP contain arrays with route
origins that have been announced and withdrawn, respectively, since the
provided session and serial. If \fIreset\fP is \fItrue\fP, the \fIwithdrawn\fP
member is not present.
.TP
.B /json\-delta/notify, /json\-delta/notify?session=session&serial=serial
Returns a JSON object with two members \fIsession\fP and \fIserial\fP which
contain the session ID and serial number of the current data set.
.sp
If the \fIsession\fP and \fIserial\fP query parameters are provided, and the
session ID and serial number of the current data set are identical
to the provided values, the request will not return until a new data
set is available. This can be used as a means to get notified when
the data set has been updated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In addition, the current set of VRPs is available for each output format at a
path with the same name as the output format. E.g., the CSV output is
available at \fB/csv\fP\&.
.sp
These paths accept selector expressions to limit the VRPs returned in the
form of a query string. The field \fBselect\-asn\fP can be used to filter for
ASNs and the field \fBselect\-prefix\fP can be used to filter for prefixes. The
fields can be repeated multiple times.
.sp
In addition, the query parameter \fBinclude=more\-specifics\fP will cause the
inclusion of VRPs for more specific prefixes of prefixes given via
\fBselect\-prefix\fP\&.
.sp
Finally, the query parameter \fBexclude\fP can be used to exclude certain
payload types from the response. The values \fBrouteOrigins\fP, \fBrouterKeys\fP,
and \fBaspas\fP disable inclusion of route origins, router keys, and ASPAs,
respectively. The values can either be given in separate \fBexclude\fP
parameters or included in one separated by commas.
.sp
These parameters work in the same way as the options of the same name to the
\fI\%vrps\fP command.
.SH LOGGING
.sp
In order to allow diagnosis of the VRP data set as well as its overall
health, Routinator logs an extensive amount of information. The log levels
used by syslog are utilized to allow filtering this information for
particular use cases.
.sp
The log levels represent the following information:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B error
Information related to events that prevent Routinator from continuing
to operate at all as well as all issues related to local configuration
even if Routinator will continue to run.
.TP
.B warn
Information about events and data that influences the set of VRPs
produced by Routinator. This includes failures to communicate with
repository servers, or encountering invalid objects.
.TP
.B info
Information about events and data that could be considered abnormal but
do not influence the set of VRPs produced. For example, when filtering
of unsafe VRPs is disabled, the unsafe VRPs are logged with this level.
.TP
.B debug
Information about the internal state of Routinator that may be useful
for, well, debugging.
.UNINDENT
.SH VALIDATION
.sp
In \fI\%vrps\fP and \fI\%server\fP mode, Routinator will produce a set of
VRPs from the data published in the RPKI repository. It will walk over all
certification authorities (CAs) starting with those referred to in the
configured TALs.
.sp
Each CA is checked whether all its published objects are present, correctly
encoded, and have been signed by the CA. If any of the objects fail this
check, the entire CA will be rejected. If an object of an unknown  type  is
encountered, the behaviour depends on the \fBunknown\-objects\fP policy. If this
policy has a value of \fIreject\fP the entire CA will be rejected. In this case,
only certificates (.cer), CRLs (.crl), manifests (.mft), ROAs (.roa), and
Ghostbuster records (.gbr) will be accepted.
.sp
If a CA is rejected, none of its ROAs will be added to the VRP set but also
none of its child CAs will be considered at all; their published data will
not be fetched or validated.
.sp
If a prefix has its ROAs published by different CAs, this will lead to some
of its VRPs being dropped while others are still added. If the VRP for the
legitimately announced route is among those having been dropped, the route
becomes RPKI invalid. This can happen both by operator error or through an
active attack.
.sp
In addition, if a VRP for a less specific prefix exists that covers the
prefix of the dropped VRP, the route will be invalidated by the less specific
VRP.
.sp
Because of this risk of accidentally or maliciously invalidating routes, VRPs
that have address prefixes overlapping with resources of rejected CAs are
called \fIunsafe VRPs\fP\&.
.sp
In order to avoid these situations and instead fall back to an RPKI unknown
state for such routes, Routinator allows to filter out these unsafe VRPs.
This can be enabled via the \fB\-\-unsafe\-vrps=reject\fP command line option or
setting \fBunsafe\-vrps=reject\fP in the config file.
.sp
By default, this filter is currently disabled but warnings are logged about
unsafe VRPs. This allows to assess the operation impact of such a filter.
Depending on this assessment, the default may change in future versions.
.sp
One exception from this rule are CAs that have the full address space
assigned, i.e., 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0. Adding these to the filter would wipe out
all VRPs. These prefixes are used by the RIR trust anchors to avoid having to
update these often. However, each RIR has its own address space so losing all
VRPs should something happen to a trust anchor is unnecessary.
.SH RELAXED DECODING
.sp
The documents defining RPKI include a number of very strict rules regarding
the formatting of the objects published in the RPKI repository. However,
because RPKI reuses existing technology, real\-world applications produce
objects that do not follow these strict requirements.
.sp
As a consequence, a significant portion of the RPKI repository is actually
invalid if the rules are followed. We therefore introduce two decoding modes:
strict and relaxed. Strict mode rejects any object that does not pass all
checks laid out by the relevant RFCs. Relaxed mode ignores a number of these
checks.
.sp
This memo documents the violations we encountered and are dealing with in
relaxed decoding mode.

Resource Certificates (\fI\%RFC 6487\fP)
Resource certificates are defined as a profile on the more general
Internet PKI certificates defined in \fI\%RFC 5280\fP\&.

.TP
.B Subject and Issuer
The RFC restricts the type used for CommonName attributes to
PrintableString, allowing only a subset of ASCII characters,
while \fI\%RFC 5280\fP allows a number of additional string types.
At least one CA produces resource certificates with
Utf8Strings.
.sp
In relaxed mode, we will only check that the general structure
of the issuer and subject fields are correct and allow any
number and types of attributes. This seems justified since RPKI
explicitly does not use these fields.

Signed Objects (\fI\%RFC 6488\fP)
Signed objects are defined as a profile on CMS messages defined in

.B DER Encoding
\fI\%RFC 6488\fP demands all signed objects to be DER encoded while
the more general CMS format allows any BER encoding \-\- DER is a
stricter subset of the more general BER. At least one CA does
indeed produce BER encoded signed objects.
.sp
In relaxed mode, we will allow BER encoding.
.sp
Note that this isn\(aqt just nit\-picking. In BER encoding, octet
strings can be broken up into a sequence of sub\-strings. Since
those strings are in some places used to carry encoded content
themselves, such an encoding does make parsing significantly
more difficult. At least one CA does produce such broken\-up
strings.

.B SIGUSR1: Reload TALs and restart validation
When receiving SIGUSR1, Routinator will attempt to reload the TALs and, if
that succeeds, restart validation. If loading the TALs fails, Routinator
will exit.

.B SIGUSR2: Re\-open log file
When receiving SIGUSR2 and logging to a file is enabled, Routinator will
re\-open the log file. If this fails, Routinator will exit.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
Upon success, the exit status 0 is returned. If any fatal error happens, the
exit status will be 1. Some commands provide a \fI\%\-\-complete\fP option
which will cause the exit status to be 2 if any of the rsync commands to
update the repository fail.
