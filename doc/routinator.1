.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Routinator
collects and processes Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) data. It
validates the Route Origin Attestations contained in the data and makes
them available to your BGP routing workflow.
.P
It can either run in one-shot mode outputting a list of validated route
origins in various formats or as a server for the RPKI-to-Router (RTR)
protocol that routers often implement to access the data, or via HTTP.
.P
These modes and additional operations can be chosen  via commands. For
the available commands, see
.B COMMANDS
below.


.SH "OPTIONS"
.P
The available options are:

.TP
.BI \-c\  path \fR,\ \fB\-\-config= path
Provides the path to a file containing basic configuration. If this option
is not given, Routinator will try to use
.I $HOME/.routinator.conf
if that exists. If that doesn't exist, either, default values for the
options as described here are used.
.IP
See
.B CONFIGURATION FILE
below for more information on the format and contents of the configuration
file.

.TP
.BI \-b\  dir \fR,\ \fB\-\-base\-dir= dir
Specifies the base directory to keep status information in. Unless
overwritten by the
.B -r
or
.B -t
options, the local repository will be kept in the sub-directory
.I repository
and the TALs will be kept in the sub-directory
.I tals\fR.
.IP
If omitted, the base directory defaults to
.I $HOME/.rpki-cache\fR.

.TP
.BI \-r\  dir \fR,\ \fB\-\-repository\-dir= dir
Specifies the directory to keep the local repository in. This is the place
where Routinator stores the RPKI data it has collected and thus is a copy of
all the data referenced via the trust anchors.

.TP
.BI \-t\  dir \fR,\ \fB\-\-tal\-dir= dir
Specifies the directory containing the trust anchor locators (TALs) to use.
Trust anchor locators are the starting points for collecting and validating
RPKI data. See
.B TRUST ANCHOR LOCATORS
for more information on what should be present in this directory.

.TP
.BI \-x\  file \fR,\ \fB\-\-exceptions= file
Provides the path to a local exceptions file. The option can be used
multiple times to specify more than one file to use. Each file is a JSON
file as described in RFC 8416. It lists both route origins that should be
filtered out of the output as well as origins that should be added.

.TP
.BR \-\-strict
If this option is present, the repository will be validated in strict mode
following the requirements laid out by the standard documents very closely.
With the current RPKI repository, using this option will lead to a rather
large amount of invalid route origins and should therefore not be used in
practice.
.IP
See
.B RELAXED VALIDATION
below for more information.

.TP
.BI --stale= policy
This option defines how deal with stale objects. In RPKI, manifests and
CRLs can be stale if the time given in their
.I next-update
field is in the past, indicating that an update to the object was
scheduled but didn't happen. This can be because of an operational issue
at the issuer or an attacker trying to replay old objects.
.IP
There are three possible policies that define how Routinator should treat
stale objects.
.IP
A policy of
.I refuse
instructs Routinator to consider all stale objects invalid. This will
result in all material published by the CA issuing this manifest and CRL
to be invalid including all material of any child CA.
.IP
The
.I warn
policy will allow Routinator to consider any stale object to be valid. It
will, however, print a warning in the log allowing an operator to follow
up on the issue. This is the default policy if the option is not provided.
.IP
Finally, the
.I accept
policy will cause Routinator to quietly accept any stale object as valid.

.TP
.B --disable-rsync
If this option is present, rsync is disabled and only RRDP will be used.

.TP
.BI \-\-rsync\-command= command
Provides the command to run for rsync. This is only the command itself.
If you need to provide options to rsync, use the
.B rsync\-args
configuration file setting instead.
.IP
If this option is not given, Routinator will simply run
.I rsync
and hope that it is in the path.

.TP
.BI \-\-rsync\-timeout= seconds
Sets the number of seconds an rsync command is allowed to run before it is
terminated early. This protects against hanging rsync commands that prevent
Routinator from continuing. The default is 300 seconds which should be long
enough except for very slow networks.

.TP
.B --disable-rrdp
If this option is present, RRDP is disabled and only rsync will be used.

.TP
.BI --rrdp-timeout= seconds
Sets the timeout in seconds for any RRDP-related network operation, i.e.,
connects, reads, and writes. If this option is omitted, the default timeout
of 30 seconds is used. Set the option to 0 to disable the timeout.

.TP
.BI --rrdp-connect-timeout= seconds
Sets the timeout in seconds for RRDP connect requests. If omitted, the general
timeout will be used.

.TP
.BI --rrdp-local-addr= addr
If present, sets the local address that the RRDP client should bind to when
doing outgoing requests.

.TP
.BI --rrdp-root-cert= path
This option provides a path to a file that contains a certificate in PEM
encoding that should be used as a trusted certificate for HTTPS server
authentication. The option can be given more than once.
.IP
Providing this option does
.I not
disable the set of regular HTTPS authentication trust certificates.

.TP
.BI --rrdp-proxy= uri
This option provides the URI of a proxy to use for all HTTP connections made
by the RRDP client. It can be either an HTTP or a SOCKS URI. The option can
be given multiple times in which case proxies are tried in the given order.

.TP
.B --dirty
If this option is present, unused files and directories will not be deleted
from the repository directory after each validation run.
.TP
.BI \-\-validation\-threads= count
Sets the number of threads to distribute work to for validation. Note that
the current processing model validates trust anchors all in one go, so you
are likely to see less than that number of threads used throughout the
validation run.
.TP
.BR \-v ,\  \fB\-\-verbose
Print more information. If given twice, even more information is printed.
.IP
More specifically, a single
.B -v
increases the log level from the default of
.I warn
to
.I info\fR,
specifying it more than once increases it to
.I debug\fR.
.TP
.BR \-q ,\  \fB\-\-quiet
Print less information. Given twice, print nothing at all.
.IP
A single
.B -q
will drop the log level to
.I error\fR.
Repeating
.B -q
more than once turns logging off completely.
.TP
.BR \-\-syslog
Redirect logging output to syslog.
.IP
This option is implied if a command is used that causes Routinator to run
in daemon mode.
.TP
.BI \-\-syslog-facility= facility
If logging to syslog is used, this option can be used to specify the syslog
facility to use. The default is
.I daemon\fR.
.TP
.BI \-\-logfile= path
Redirect logging output to the given file.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Print some help information.
.TP
.BR \-V , " \-\-version
Print version information.


.SH COMMANDS
Routinator provides a number of operations around the local RPKI repository.
These can be requested by providing different commands on the command line.

.SS init
Prepares the local repository directories and the TAL directory for running
Routinator. Specifically, makes sure the local repository directory exists,
and creates the TAL directory and fills it with the TALs of the five RIRs.
.P
For more information about TALs, see
.B TRUST ANCHOR LOCATORS
below.
.TP
.B -f
Forces installation of the TALs even if the TAL directory already exists.
.TP
.B --accept-arin-rpa
Before you can use the ARIN TAL, you need to agree to the ARIN Relying Party
Agreement (RPA). You can find it at
.I https://www.arin.net/resources/manage/rpki/rpa.pdf
and explicitly agree to it via this option. This explicit agreement is
necessary in order to install the ARIN TAL.
.TP
.B --decline-arin-rpa
If, after reading the ARIN Relying Party Agreement, you decide you do not or
cannot agree to it, this option allows you to skip installation of the ARIN
TAL. Note that this means Routinator will not have access to any information
published for resources assigned under ARIN.

.SS vrps
This command requests that Routinator update the local repository and then
validate the Route Origin Attestations in the repository and output the
valid route origins, which are also known as Validated ROA Payload or VRPs,
as a list.
.TP
.BI -o\  file \fR,\ \fB\-\-output= file
Specifies the output file to write the list to. If this option is missing
or file is
.I "-"
the list is printed to standard output.
.TP
.BI -f\  format \fR,\ \fB\-\-format= format
The output format to use. Routinator currently supports the following formats:
.RS
.TP
.B csv
The list is formatted as lines of comma-separated values of the prefix in
slash notation, the maximum prefix length, the autonomous system number, and
an abbreviation for the trust anchor the entry is derived from. The latter is
the name of the TAL file without the extension
.IR ".tal" .
.IP
This is the default format used if the
.B -f
option is missing.
.TP
.B csvext
An extended version of
.I csv
each line contains these comma-separated values: the rsync URI of the ROA
the line is taken from (or "N/A" if it isn't from a ROA), the autonomous
system number, the prefix in slash notation, the maximum prefix length, the
not-before date and not-after date of the validity of the ROA.
.IP
This format was used in the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator version 1. That version
produces one file per trust anchor. This is not currently supported by
Routinator -- all entries will be in one single output file.
.TP
.B json
The list is placed into a JSON object with a single element
.I "roas"
which contains an array of objects with four elements each: The autonomous
system number of the network authorized to originate a prefix in
.IR "asn" ,
the prefix in slash notation in
.IR "prefix" ,
the maximum prefix length of the announced route in
.IR "maxLength" ,
and the trust anchor from which the authorization was derived in
.IR "ta" .
This format is identical to that produced by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator
except for different naming of the trust anchor. Routinator uses the name
of the TAL file without the extension
.IR ".tal"
whereas the RIPE NCC Validator has a dedicated name for each.
.TP
.B openbgpd
Choosing this format causes Routinator to produce a
.I "roa-set"
configuration item for the OpenBGPD configuration.
.TP
.B bird
Choosing this format causes Routinator to produce a
.I "roa table"
configuration item for the BIRD configuration.
.TP
.B bird2
Choosing this format causes Routinator to produce a
.I "route table"
configuration item for the BIRD2 configuration.
.TP
.B rpsl
This format produces a list of RPSL objects with the authorization in the
fields
.IR route ,
.IR origin ,
and
.IR source .
In addition, the fields
.IR descr ,
.IR mnt-by ,
.IR created ,
and
.IR last-modified ,
are present with more or less meaningful values.
.TP
.B summary
This format produces a summary of the content of the RPKI repository. For
each trust anchor, it will print the number of verified ROAs and VRPs. Note
that this format does not take filters into account. It will always provide
numbers for the complete repository.
.TP
.B none
This format produces no output whatsoever.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-n ,\  \-\-noupdate
The repository will not be updated before producing the list.
.TP
.B \-\-complete
If any of the rsync commands needed to update the repository failed, complete
the operation but provide exit status 2. If this option is not given, the
operation will complete with exit status 0 in this case.
.TP
.BI \-a \ asn\fR,\  \-\-filter\-asn= asn
Only output VRPs for the given ASN. The option can be given multiple times,
in which case VRPs for all provided ASNs are provided. ASNs can be given with
or without the prefix
.IR AS .
.TP
.BI \-p \ prefix\fR,\  \-\-filter\-prefix= prefix
Only output VRPs with an address prefix that covers the given prefix, i.e.,
whose prefix is equal to or less specific than the given prefix. This will
include VRPs regardless of their ASN and max length. In other words, the
output will include all VRPs that need to be considered when deciding whether
an announcement for the prefix is RPKI valid or invalid.
.IP
The option can be given multiple times, in which case VRPs for all prefixes
are provided. It can also be combined with one or more ASN filters. Then all
matching VRPs are included. That is, filters combine as "or" not "and."

.SS validate
This command can be used to perform RPKI route origin validation for a route
announcement. Routinator will determine whether the provided announcement is
RPKI valid, invalid, or not found.
.TP
.BI \-a \ asn\fR,\  \-\-asn= asn
The AS number of the autonomous system that originated the route
announcement. ASNs can be given with
or without the prefix
.IR AS .
.TP
.BI \-p \ prefix\fR,\  \-\-prefix= prefix
The address prefix the route announcement is for.
.TP
.BR \-j ,\  \-\-json
A detailed analysis on the reasoning behind the validation is printed in
JSON format including lists of the VPRs that caused the particular result.
If this option is omitted, Routinator will only print the determined
state.
.TP
.BR \-n ,\  \-\-noupdate
The repository will not be updated before performing validation.
.TP
.B \-\-complete
If any of the rsync commands needed to update the repository failed, complete
the operation but provide exit status 2. If this option is not given, the
operation will complete with exit status 0 in this case.

.SS server
This command causes Routinator to act as a server for the RPKI-to-Router
(RTR) and HTTP protocols. In this mode, Routinator will read all the TALs
(See
.B TRUST ANCHOR LOCATORS
below) and will stay attached to the terminal unless the
.B -d
option is given.
.PP
The server will periodically update the local repository, every ten minutes
by default, notify any clients of changes, and let them fetch validated data.
It will not, however, reread the trust anchor locators. Thus, if you update
them, you will have to restart Routinator.
.PP
You can provide a number of addresses and ports to listen on for RTR and HTTP
through command line options or their configuration file equivalent.
Currently, Routinator will only start listening on these ports after an
initial validation run has finished.
.PP
It will not listen on any sockets unless explicitly specified. It
will still run and periodically update the repository. This might be useful
for use with
.B vrps
mode with the
.B -n
option.
.TP
.B --detach
If present, Routinator will detach from the terminal after a successful start.
.TP
.BI \-\-rtr=  addr:port
Specifies a local address and port to listen on for incoming RTR connections.
.IP
Routinator supports both protocol version 0 defined in RFC 6810 and version
1 defined in RFC 8210. However, it does not support router keys introduced
in version 1. IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets. You can
provide the option multiple times to let Routinator listen on multiple
address-port pairs.
.TP
.BI \-\-http= addr:port
Specifies the address and port to listen on for incoming HTTP connections.
See
.B HTTP SERVICE
below for more information on the HTTP service provided by Routinator.
.TP
.BI \-\-listen\-systemd
The RTR listening socket will be acquired from systemd via socket
activation. Use this option together with systemd’s socket units to allow a
Routinator running as a regular user to bind to the default RTR port 323.
.IP
Currently, all TCP listener sockets handed over by systemd will be used for
the RTR protocol.
.TP
.BI \-\-refresh= seconds
The amount of seconds the server should wait after having finished updating
and validating the local repository before starting to update again. The
next update will earlier if objects in the repository expire earlier. The
default value is 600 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-\-retry= seconds
The amount of seconds to suggest to an RTR client to wait before trying to
request data again if that failed. The default value is 600 seconds, the
value recommended in RFC 8210.
.TP
.BI \-\-expire= seconds
The amount of seconds to an RTR client can keep using data if it cannot
refresh it. After that time, the client should discard the data. Note that
this value was introduced in version 1 of the RTR protocol and is thus not
relevant for clients that only implement version 0. The default value, as
recommended in RFC 8210, is 7200 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-\-history= count
In RTR, a client can request to only receive the changes that happened since
the last version of the data it had seen. This option sets how many change
sets the server will at most keep. If a client requests changes from an older
version, it will get the current full set.
.IP
Note that routers typically stay connected with their RTR server and therefore
really only ever need one single change set. Additionally, if RTR server or
router are restarted, they will have a new session with new change sets and
need to exchange a full data set, too. Thus, increasing the value probably
only ever increases memory consumption.
.IP
The default value is 10.
.TP
.BI \-\-pid\-file= path
States a file which will be used in daemon mode to store the processes PID.
While the process is running, it will keep the file locked.
.TP
.BI \-\-working\-dir= path
The working directory for the daemon process. In daemon mode, Routinator
will change to this directory while detaching from the terminal.
.TP
.BI \-\-chroot= path
The root directory for the daemon process. If this option is provided, the
daemon process will change its root directory to the given directory. This
will only work if all other paths provided via the configuration or command
line options are under this directory.
.TP
.BI --user= user-name
The name of the user to change to for the daemon process. It this option is
provided, Routinator will run as that user after the listening sockets for
HTTP and RTR have been created. The option has no effect unless
.B --detach
is also used.
.TP
.BI --group= group-name
The name of the group to change to for the daemon process. It this option is
provided, Routinator will run as that group after the listening sockets for
HTTP and RTR have been created. The option has no effect unless
.B --detach
is also used.

.SS update
Updates the local repository by resyncing all known publication points. The
command will also validate the updated repository to discover any new
publication points that appear in the repository and fetch their data.
.PP
As such, the command really is a shortcut for running
.B routinator vrps -f none\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-complete
If any of the rsync commands needed to update the repository failed, complete
the operation but provide exit status 2. If this option is not given, the
operation will complete with exit status 0 in this case.

.SS man
Displays the manual page, i.e., this page.
.TP
.BI -o\  file \fR,\ \fB\-\-output= file
If this option is provided, the manual page will be written to the given
file instead of displaying it. Use
.I "-"
to output the manual page to standard output.


.SH TRUST ANCHOR LOCATORS
RPKI uses trust anchor locators, or TALs, to identify the location and
public keys of the trusted root CA certificates. Routinator keeps these
TALs in files in the TAL directory which can be set by the
.B \-t
option. If the
.B \-b
option is used instead, the TAL directory will be in the sub-directory
.I tals
under the directory specified in this option. The default location, if
no options are used at all is
.I $HOME/.rpki-cache/tals\fR.
.P
This directory can be created and populated with the TALs of the five
Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) via the
.B init
command.
.P
If the directory does exist, Routinator will use all files with an extension
of
.I .tal
in this directory. This means that you can add and remove trust anchors by
adding and removing files in this directory. If you add files, make sure they
are in the format described by RFC 7730 or the upcoming RFC 8630.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
Instead of providing all options on the command line, they can also be
provided through a configuration file. Such a file can be selected through
the
.B -c
option. If no configuration file is specified this way but a file named
.I $HOME/.routinator.conf
is present, this file is used.
.PP
The configuration file is a file in TOML format. In short, it consists of
a sequence of key-value pairs, each on its own line. Strings are to be
enclosed in double quotes. Lists can be given by enclosing a comma-separated
list of values in square brackets.
.PP
The configuration file can contain the following entries. All path values
are interpreted relative to the directory the configuration file is located.
in. All values can be overwritten via the command line options.
.TP
.B repository-dir
A string containing the path to the directory to store the local repository
in. This entry is mandatory.
.TP
.B tal-dir
A string containing the path to the directory that contains the Trust Anchor
Locators. This entry is mandatory.
.TP
.B exceptions
A list of strings, each containing the path to a file with local exceptions.
If missing, no local exception files are used.
.TP
.B strict
A boolean specifying whether strict validation should be employed. If missing,
strict validation will not be used.

.TP
.B stale
A string specifying the policy for dealing with stale objects.
.RS
.TP
.I refuse
Consider all stale objects invalid rendering all material published by the CA
issuing the stale object to be invalid including all material of any child CA.
.TP
.I warn
Consider stale objects to be valid but print a warning to the log.
.TP
.I accept
Quietly consider stale objects valid.
.RE

.TP
.B disable-rsync
A boolean value that, if present and true, turns off the use of rsync.

.TP
.B rsync-command
A string specifying the command to use for running rsync. The default is
simply
.IR rsync .
.TP
.B rsync-args
A list of strings containing the arguments to be passed to the rsync command.
Each string is an argument of its own.
.IP
If this
option is not provided, Routinator will try to find out if your rsync
understands the
.B \-\-contimeout
option and, if so, will set it to 10 thus letting connection attempts time
out after ten seconds. If your rsync is too old to support this option, no
arguments are used.
.TP
.B rsync-timeout
An integer value specifying the number of seconds an rsync command is allowed to
run before it is being terminated. The default if the value is missing is
300 seconds.

.TP
.B disable-rrdp
A boolean value that, if present and true, turns off the use of RRDP.

.TP
.B rrdp-timeout
An integer value that provides a timeout in seconds for all individual
RRDP-related network operations, i.e., connects, reads, and writes. If the
value is missing, a default timeout of 30 seconds will be used. Set the value
to 0 to turn the timeout off.

.TP
.B rrdp-connect-timeout
An integer value that, if present, sets a separate timeout in seconds for
RRDP connect requests only.

.TP
.B rrdp-local-addr
A string value that provides the local address to be used by RRDP connections.

.TP
.B rrdp-root-certs
A list of strings each providing a path to a file containing a trust anchor
certificate for HTTPS authentication of RRDP connections. In addition to the
certificates provided via this option, the system's own trust store is used.

.TP
.B rrdp-proxies
A list of string each providing the URI for a proxy for outgoing RRDP
connections. The proxies are tried in order for each request. HTTP and SOCKS5
proxies are supported.

.TP
.B dirty
A boolean value which, if true, specifies that unused files and directories
should not be deleted from the repository directory after each validation run.
If left out, its value will be false and unused files will be deleted.
.TP
.B validation-threads
An integer value specifying the number of threads to be used during
validation of the repository. If this value is missing, the number of CPUs
in the system is used.
.TP
.B log-level
A string value specifying the maximum log level for which log messages should
be emitted. The default is
.IR warn .
.TP
.B log
A string specifying where to send log messages to. This can be one of the
following values:
.RS
.TP
.I default
Log messages will be sent to standard error if Routinator stays attached to
the terminal or to syslog if it runs in daemon mode.
.TP
.I stderr
Log messages will be sent to standard error.
.TP
.I syslog
Log messages will be sent to syslog.
.TP
.I file
Log messages will be sent to the file specified through the
.B log-file
configuration file entry.
.RE
.IP
The default if this value is missing is, unsurprisingly,
.IR default .
.TP
.B log-file
A string value containing the path to a file to which log messages will be
appended if the
.B log
configuration value is set to
.IR file .
In this case, the value is mandatory.
.TP
.B syslog-facility
A string value specifying the syslog facility to use for logging to syslog.
The default value if this entry is missing is
.IR daemon .
.TP
.B rtr-listen
An array of string values each providing the address and port which the RTR
daemon should listen on in TCP mode. Address and port should be separated by
a colon. IPv6 address should be enclosed in square brackets.
.TP
.B http-listen
An array of string values each providing the address and port which the HTTP
service should listen on. Address and port should be separated by
a colon. IPv6 address should be enclosed in square brackets.
.TP
.B listen-systemd
The RTR TCP listening socket will be acquired from systemd via socket
activation. Use this option together with systemd’s socket units to allow a
Routinator running as a regular user to bind to the default RTR port 323.
.TP
.B refresh
An integer value specifying the number of seconds Routinator should wait
between consecutive validation runs in server mode. The next validation run
will happen earlier, if objects expire earlier. The default is 600 seconds.
.TP
.B retry
An integer value specifying the number of seconds an RTR client is requested
to wait after it failed to receive a data set. The default is 600 seconds.
.TP
.B expire
An integer value specifying the number of seconds an RTR client is requested
to use a data set if it cannot get an update before throwing it away and
continuing with no data at all. The default is 7200 seconds.
if it cannot get an update before throwing it away and
continuing with no data at all. The default is 7200 seconds.
.TP
.B history-size
An integer value specifying how many change sets Routinator should keep in
RTR server mode. The default is 10.
.TP
.B pid-file
A string value containing a path pointing to the PID file to be used in
daemon mode.
.TP
.B working-dir
A string value containing a path to the working directory for the daemon
process.
.TP
.B chroot
A string value containing the path any daemon process should use as its
root directory.
.TP
.B user
A string value containing the user name a daemon process should run as.
.TP
.B group
A string value containing the group name a daemon process should run as.

.SH HTTP SERVICE
Routinator can provide an HTTP service allowing to fetch the Validated ROA
Payload in various formats. The service does not support HTTPS and should
only be used within the local network.
.P
The service only supports GET requests with the following
paths:

.TP
.B /csv
Returns the current set of VRPs in
.B csv
output format.
.TP
.B /json
Returns the current set of VRPs in
.B json
output format.
.TP
.B /metrics
Returns a set of monitoring metrics in the format used by Prometheus.
.TP
.B /openbgpd
Returns the current set of VRPs in
.B openbgpd
output format.
.TP
.B /bird
Returns the current set of VRPs in
.B bird
output format.
.TP
.B /bird2
Returns the current set of VRPs in
.B bird2
output format.
.TP
.B /rpsl
Returns the current set of VRPs in
.B rpsl
output format.
.TP
.B /status
Returns the current status of the Routinator instance. This is similar to
the output of the
.B /metrics
endpoint but in a more human friendly format.
.TP
.B /version
Returns the version of the Routinator instance.
.TP
.B /api/v1/validity/\fIas-number\fB/\fIprefix
Returns a JSON object describing whether the route announcement given by
its origin AS number and address prefix is RPKI valid, invalid, or not found.
The returned object is compatible with that provided by the RIPE NCC RPKI
Validator. For more information, see
.I https://www.ripe.net/support/documentation/developer-documentation/rpki-validator-api
.TP
.B /validity?asn=\fIas-number\fB&prefix=\fIprefix
Same as above but with a more form-friendly calling convention.

.P
The paths that output the current set of VRPs accept filter expressions to
limit the VRPs returned in the form of a query string. The field
.B filter-asn
can be used to filter for ASNs and the field
.B filter-prefix
can be used to filter for prefixes. The fields can be repeated multiple
times.
.P
This works in the same way as the options of the same name to the
.B vrps
command.

.SH RELAXED VALIDATION
The documents defining RPKI include a number of very strict rules
regarding the formatting of the objects published in the RPKI repository.
However, because PRKI reuses existing technology, real-world applications
produce objects that do not follow these strict requirements.
.PP
As a consequence, a significant portion of the RPKI repository is actually
invalid if the rules are followed. We therefore introduce two validation
modes: strict and relaxed. Strict mode rejects any object that does not
pass all checks laid out by the relevant RFCs. Relaxed mode ignores a
number of these checks.
.PP
This memo documents the violations we encountered and are dealing with in
relaxed validation mode.

.SS Resource Certificates (RFC 6487)

Resource certificates are defined as a profile on the more general
Internet PKI certificates defined in RFC 5280.

.TP
.B Subject and Issuer
The RFC restricts the type used for CommonName attributes to
PrintableString, allowing only a subset of ASCII characters, while RFC
5280 allows a number of additional string types. At least one CA produces
resource certificates with Utf8Strings.
.IP
In relaxed mode, we will only check that the general structure of the
issuer and subject fields are correct and allow any number and types of
attributes. This seems justified since RPKI explicitly does not use these
fields.

.SS Signed Objects (RFC 6488)
Signed objects are defined as a profile on CMS messages defined in RFC
5652.
.TP
.B DER Encoding
RFC 6488 demands all signed objects to be DER encoded while the more
general CMS format allows any BER encoding -- DER is a stricter subset of
the more general BER. At least one CA does indeed produce BER encoded
signed objects.
.IP
In relaxed mode, we will allow BER encoding.
.IP
Note that this isn't just nit-picking. In BER encoding, octet strings can
be broken up into a sequence of sub-strings. Since those strings are in
some places used to carry encoded content themselves, such an encoding
does make parsing significantly more difficult. At least one CA does
produce such broken-up strings.

.SH SIGNALS
.SS SIGUSR1: Reload TALs and restart validation
When receiving SIGUSR1, Routinator will attempt to reload the TALs and, if
that succeeds, restart validation. If loading the TALs fails, Routinator will
exit.

.SH EXIT STATUS
Upon success, the exit status 0 is returned. If any fatal error happens,
the exit status will be 1. Some commands provide a
.B --complete
option which will cause the exit status to be 2 if any of the rsync commands
to update the repository fail.
