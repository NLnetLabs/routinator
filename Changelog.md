# Change Log

## Unreleased next version

Breaking Changes

New

* The `config` command now prints the configuration in TOML format and
  can be used to create a configuration file for the current
  configuration. [(#54)]
* Routinator now builds and runs on Windows. Given that Windows is a Rust
  tier 1 platform, we wanted to see how difficult it is to get this
  going. Note that you will need the `rsync` executable that comes with
  [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). [(#55)]

Bug Fixes

* Actually use `$HOME/.routinator.conf` as the default config file as
  promised by the documentation. [(#49)]
* Fix a compile time error on 32 bit systems.

## 0.2.0 ‘Instant Gezellig’

Breaking Changes

* The command line arguments have been restructured to use commands to
  determine the mode of operation rather than options. In the course of
  that, some options changed, too. [(#35)]
* Add trust anchor information to the CSV, JSON, and RPSL output. [(#21)]

New

* Add a configuration file for all standard options and the options for
  the RTR server mode. [(#35)]
* Add a `Dockerfile` for building and deploying through Docker. Thanks to
  David Monosov. [(#23)]
* Output from the rsync runs is now send to the logger and will be handled
  according to log settings. Output to stderr is logged with log level
  _warn,_ stdout is logged with _info._ [(#27)]
* New options for daemon mode: `pid-file`, `working-dir`, and `chroot`.
  Options to change the user and group in daemon mode are coming soon.
  [(#42)]
* In daemon mode, forking now happens _after_ the TALs are checked so that
  you can see the error messages and that it fails.
* New VRP output format `openbgpd` which produces a `roa-set` for
  [OpenBGPD](http://www.openbgpd.org/) config.
  Thanks to Job Snijders. [(#32)]
* A new command line and config file option `rsync-command` allows to
  choose which command to run for rsync. A new config file option
  `rsync-args` allows to provide arguments to rsync. [(#41)]

Bug Fixes

* The default output format was accidentally changed to `none`. It is
  `csv` again.

Performance Improvements

* Caching of CRL serial numbers for CAs with large manifests leads to
  about half the validation time for the current repository. [(#34)]
